"""
AgriSense ML Service — Base Agent (Future-Ready Scaffolding)
=============================================================

Purpose:
    Defines the abstract contract for ALL future agents in the system.
    The current chatbot is the only agent, but this base class ensures
    that future agents (Disease, Pest, Weather, NDVI, Yield, Satellite)
    follow a consistent interface.

Why it exists:
    When the system migrates to LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration,
    each agent will be a node in the graph. This base class ensures all
    agents have the same input/output contract, making that migration
    straightforward.

Design for LangGraph compatibility:
    - Each agent has a `name` and `description` (used for routing).
    - The `run()` method takes a query + context and returns a structured result.
    - State is passed in via `context` dict, not stored on the agent.
    - This mirrors LangGraph's "tool-like" node pattern.

Interactions:
    - Extended by: future agent implementations
    - Will be consumed by: LangGraph routing logic (future)
